# Templates

Templates are starting points for projects.  They can initialize every aspect of a project, including [2D](/overlay) and [3D](/entities) elements, [scripts](/scipts), [assets](/assets), and [apps](/apps).  Once a project is initialized from a template, the template cannot be changed, but the individual elements of the page can be updated as usual.
