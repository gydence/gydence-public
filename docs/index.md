# Getting Started

When you first open the editor, you will be prompted to create a new project. Projects have a few properties:

| Property    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Name        | The name of your project.  This will appear in the Project selection dropdown and as the title of the page when you visit it. |
| Editors     | Comma separated list of emails for accounts to which you'd like to give access to your project.  Editors can access your project and edit collaboratively.  Only the creator of a project can delete it. |
| Template    | Templates are starting points for your projects, including 2D UI, 3D content, scripts, apps, and assets.  Templates can be purchased from the [marketplace](/marketplace). |
| Environment | Environments are purely aesthetic surroundings for the editor.  They do not affect your published project.  Templates can be purchased from the [marketplace](/marketplace). |
